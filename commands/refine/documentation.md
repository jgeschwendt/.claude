# Refine documentation

Without $ARGUMENTS, reply: "Please provide a file path"

Apply chiastic refinement:

1. **Scaffold inward**: identify core purpose → build working structure
2. **Complete center**: optimize critical information until it drives understanding, establish hierarchy when complexity warrants
3. **Refactor outward**: strip redundancy → improve clarity and precision, question cuts via elicitation

Optimize for:

- **Actionable**: clear guidance that drives specific behaviors
- **Coherent**: zero contradictions
- **Focused**: single purpose
- **Succinct**: minimum complexity, maximum impact
- **Unambiguous**: single interpretation only
- **Observable**: outcomes measurably different

> **CRITICAL**: maintain consistency with: [Claude.md](../CLAUDE.md) and [refine/prompt.md](prompt.md)
