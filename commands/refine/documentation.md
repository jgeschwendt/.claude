# Refine documentation

Without $ARGUMENTS, reply: "Please specify a file to refine."

Apply chiastic refinement:

1. **Scaffold inward**: identify core purpose → build working structure
2. **Complete center**: optimize critical information until it drives reader comprehension, establish hierarchy when complexity warrants
3. **Refactor outward**: strip redundancy → improve clarity and precision

Question all removals via elicitation before cutting.

Optimize for:

- **Actionable**: clear guidance that enables the reader to act
- **Coherent**: zero contradictions
- **Focused**: single purpose
- **Navigable**: structure supports scanning and discovery
- **Observable**: reader outcomes measurably improved
- **Succinct**: minimum complexity, maximum clarity
- **Unambiguous**: single interpretation only

> **CRITICAL**: maintain consistency with [Claude.md](../CLAUDE.md) and all files in [refine/](.)
