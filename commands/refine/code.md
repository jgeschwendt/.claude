# Refine code

Without $ARGUMENTS, reply: "Please specify a file to refine."

Apply chiastic refinement:

1. **Scaffold inward**: identify core logic → understand intent and dependencies
2. **Complete center**: optimize critical paths until behavior is correct and efficient
3. **Refactor outward**: strip redundancy → improve structure and clarity

Question all removals via elicitation before cutting.

Optimize for:

- **Coherent**: zero contradictions in logic or architecture
- **Efficient**: no unnecessary complexity or operations
- **Maintainable**: modular structure, low coupling
- **Readable**: clear intent, well-named identifiers
- **Tested**: adequate coverage for critical paths
- **Working**: tests pass, runtime behavior correct

> **CRITICAL**: maintain consistency with [Claude.md](../CLAUDE.md) and all files in [refine/](.)
