# monitor-github: the daemon & push delivery, explained

How continuous monitoring works in this skill: a background daemon turns
GitHub changes into events, conversations subscribe as _sessions_ with a
repo scope, and a Claude Code hook injects pending events into the
conversation with every message you send — so notifications just show up.

## The routing rule (the contract)

1. A conversation attached from **inside a repo clone** is scoped to that
   repo and receives **only that repo's** notifications.
2. A conversation attached **anywhere else** is global and receives every
   notification **except** those for repos currently claimed by a live
   repo-scoped session.
3. Claims release when a scoped session **detaches** or **expires** (2 hours
   without polling) — a dead conversation can never silently hold a repo's
   notifications hostage.

So: open Claude Code in `~/code/acme-api` and that conversation owns
`acme/api` news; open another conversation from your home directory and it
picks up everything else, with zero configuration. Two sessions scoped to
the same repo both receive its events. Events with no repo (like the
startup notice) go to everyone at baseline, otherwise to global sessions.

## Architecture

```
daemon (monitor.sh _daemon)
  │  every 120s
  ▼
gh_dashboard.sh ──▶ GitHub GraphQL (2 calls)
  │  snapshot json
  ▼
diff_events.jq  (old state.json vs new)
  │  events [{ts, repo, key, type,
  │           severity, title, url}]
  ▼
drop muted → append history.jsonl
  ▼
route by scope claims
  ▼
queues/<session>.jsonl   (one per conversation)
  ▲
  │  drained by
hook_poll.sh (each prompt)  or  monitor.sh poll <id>
```

Everything is plain files under `~/.local/state/github-monitor`
(override with `GITHUB_MONITOR_DIR`): `daemon.pid`, `daemon.log`,
`state.json` (last snapshot), `sessions/`, `queues/`, `cc-map/`
(Claude Code session → monitor session), `history.jsonl` (rolling log of
delivered events), `mutes.json`, `watches.json`, and `failcount` +
`degraded` (the consecutive-failure counter and connection-lost marker).
Writes are atomic — queue drains use `mv`, state saves use
temp-then-rename — so a crash loses at most one tick and can't corrupt
anything. The daemon reuses `gh_dashboard.sh` as its only collector, so
snapshot mode and monitoring can never disagree about what the data means.
Every event carries a `key` (`"owner/repo#N"`, or null for repo-wide events
like releases); mutes match on `repo` or `key`.

The first-ever tick captures a baseline silently and sends a single
"monitoring started" notice — no spam about things that were already true.
Watched repos likewise baseline silently on first sighting. Degraded mode:
after 3 consecutive failed polls the daemon broadcasts one `monitor_degraded`
event to every session (telling the user to check `gh auth status`), and
broadcasts `monitor_recovered` when polling succeeds again — so a broken token
or network never leaves the monitor silently dark.

## Push delivery: three channels

In-session, the preferred channel is the harness's **Monitor tool** wrapped
around `monitor.sh poll` (see SKILL.md) — push delivery with zero config, no
hook install. The hook below is the always-on alternative that covers every
future session; plain `poll` is the manual fallback.

## Push delivery: how the Claude Code hook works

Claude Code has no dedicated monitor tool, but its **hooks** provide the
delivery channel (verified against current docs):

- Hooks are shell commands that fire at lifecycle events and receive JSON
  (`session_id`, `cwd`, `prompt`, …) on stdin.
- On **UserPromptSubmit** and **SessionStart**, whatever the hook prints to
  stdout is injected as context Claude sees — that's the push mechanism.
- Exit code **2** from UserPromptSubmit _blocks your prompt_, so
  `hook_poll.sh` is engineered to always exit 0 and to print nothing at all
  when there's no news.
- Hook config is snapshotted at session start (review with `/hooks`), so it
  applies from your next session. Hook output is capped at 10k characters;
  the adapter prints at most 30 events and tells Claude how to get the rest.

Per message, the flow is: hook fires → reads `session_id` + `cwd` → **first
time only:** attaches a monitor session (scope auto-detected from the cwd
via `gh repo view`, falling back to parsing the `origin` remote), records
the mapping in `cc-map/`, and announces the scope → **every time:** drains
this conversation's queue and prints events as bullet lines with severity
and URL. Polling doubles as the heartbeat that keeps the repo claim alive;
go quiet for 2h and the session expires. Wiring the same script into
**SessionEnd** (included in the generated config) detaches instantly
instead of waiting for the TTL.

## Setup

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/monitor-github/scripts/monitor.sh hook-config
# merge the printed snippet into ~/.claude/settings.json, check /hooks,
# then start a new session
```

Requires `gh` (authenticated) and `jq`. GitHub Enterprise works via
`GH_HOST` (the daemon inherits it at start). Without the hook, everything
still works pull-style: Claude runs `poll` when you ask "anything new?".

## Command reference

| Command                                                | Does                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `monitor.sh attach [--repo o/r \| --global]`           | Register a session (auto-scopes from cwd); starts the daemon if needed |
| `monitor.sh poll <id>`                                 | Drain pending events (JSONL; empty = no news; heartbeats the claim)    |
| `monitor.sh detach <id>`                               | Unregister and release the repo claim                                  |
| `monitor.sh status`                                    | Daemon pid + interval + sessions, mutes, watches, `history_lines`      |
| `monitor.sh history [--since Nm\|Nh\|Nd] [--repo o/r]` | Replay delivered events from the rolling log (default 24h)             |
| `monitor.sh mute <o/r \| o/r#N> [--for Nm\|Nh\|Nd]`    | Suppress events for a repo or item (no `--for` = until unmuted)        |
| `monitor.sh unmute <target \| --all>`                  | Lift a mute                                                            |
| `monitor.sh watch <o/r>` / `unwatch <o/r>`             | Opt-in activity watching of a repo's new PRs/issues + latest release   |
| `monitor.sh start [--interval N]` / `stop`             | Daemon lifecycle (stop keeps sessions)                                 |
| `monitor.sh tick`                                      | One foreground poll cycle (debugging)                                  |
| `monitor.sh hook-config`                               | Print the settings.json snippet for push delivery                      |

`watch` does not start the daemon (only `attach`/`start` do) — a running daemon
is required for watched-repo events to fire. `history` replays only _delivered_
events, so muted repos/items never appear; the log caps at ~5000 lines and
rotates to the newest 2500.

## Cost & limits

A tick is 2 GraphQL calls (~1 rate-limit point each) plus one cheap lookup
per merged/closed PR (and one per `ci_failed`, to name the failing checks).
A non-empty watch list adds one GraphQL query per tick for the whole list plus
one REST (latest-release) call per watched repo. At
the default 120s interval a bare tick is ~720 light calls a day against a
5,000-point/hour GraphQL budget — negligible. Sections cap at 50 items per
query and thread stats cover the first 50 threads per PR; the drill-down
script paginates when you need complete depth on one PR.

## What's been tested (and what hasn't)

Exercised by `scripts/selftest.sh` (50 cases) against simulated GitHub
responses: the full routing contract (scoped-only delivery, global exclusion
of claimed repos, claim release on detach), the hook lifecycle (attach
announcement, baseline notice, event injection, silence when quiet, SessionEnd
cleanup), every new event type, mute/unmute (repo + item, TTL expiry), the
watched-repo baseline and activity events, history windowing, degraded/recovered
broadcasts, remote parsing for ssh and https origins, all argument forms, and
atomic queue drains. Live-verified against a real GitHub account 2026-07-14;
`monitor.sh tick` + `daemon.log` remain the debugging tools if anything
surprises.
