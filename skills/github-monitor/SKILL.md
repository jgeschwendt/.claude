description: Monitor the user's GitHub and triage what needs their attention - their open pull requests (CI status, review decisions, merge conflicts, unresolved review comments), PRs waiting on their review (including unsubmitted pending reviews), and issues assigned to them. Includes a background daemon for continuous, repo-scoped notifications. Use this whenever the user asks to check their GitHub, asks "what's waiting on me", "any PRs I need to review?", "how are my PRs doing?", "did CI pass?", "any comments on my PR?", wants to watch/monitor a repo or be notified of GitHub changes, asks "anything new?" while monitoring, wants a GitHub status/dashboard/standup summary, or mentions review requests, review feedback, unresolved comments, or their open PRs - even if they never say the word "GitHub".

# GitHub Monitor

Answer one question fast: **what on GitHub needs the user's attention right now?**
Two modes: an on-demand dashboard snapshot, and a background daemon that turns
snapshot _changes_ into notifications, scoped per conversation.

Everything uses the GraphQL API (`gh api graphql`) rather than
`gh pr view --json` or REST, because review conversations - thread grouping,
`isResolved`, `isOutdated`, unsubmitted pending reviews - only exist in
GraphQL. `references/review-data-guide.md` explains what lives where;
`references/graphql-fields-reference.md` is the exhaustive, schema-generated
list of every field on every relevant type (consult it before claiming a data
point doesn't exist, or when extending the queries);
`references/monitoring-guide.md` documents the daemon architecture, routing
rule, and hook delivery in depth.

## Snapshot mode

Run the bundled collector (`$SKILL` = `~/.claude/skills/github-monitor` — Bash runs from the project cwd, so always use full paths):

```bash
bash $SKILL/scripts/gh_dashboard.sh        # up to 20 items per section
bash $SKILL/scripts/gh_dashboard.sh 50     # raise the cap (max 50)
```

Two API calls (~2s), one JSON object out: `my_prs`, `review_requests`
(sorted longest-waiting first, so overdue reviews never fall off the end),
and `assigned_issues`. Requires the `gh` CLI, authenticated, plus `jq` for
the daemon. On failure it prints `{"error": ..., "hint": ...}` - relay the
hint (usually `gh auth login`). GitHub Enterprise: prefix commands with
`GH_HOST=github.mycorp.com`.

## Triage

Sort every item into three buckets; the user should be able to read only the
first section and know what to do next.

**🔴 Needs your action**

**🟡 Waiting on others** - open non-draft PRs matching no row above (review
pending, CI running, `waiting_on_reviewer` threads). Untouched > 7 days →
flag ⚠ and offer to draft a nudge.

**⚪ FYI** - drafts, draft review requests, assigned issues. One line each.

A PR can match several rows - report the most actionable problem first.

## Reporting

Compact and scannable; renders in a terminal. Lead with the needs-action
count, link every item, humanize timestamps ("waiting 5d"). Example shape:

```
## GitHub - octocat

🔴 Needs you (3)
1. ⚠ Unsubmitted review on acme/api#377 "Retry logic" - pending comments nobody can see
2. Review acme/web#88 "Auth refactor" - @sara, waiting 8d ⚠, +310 -42 in 12 files, CI ✅
3. Reply to 3 comments on acme/api#412 "Add rate limiting" (1 outdated)

🟡 Waiting on others (1)
- acme/api#401 "Retry queue" - you answered 2 threads, awaiting @tom (2d)

⚪ FYI: 1 draft · 2 assigned issues
```

Close with a one-line recommendation when one item is clearly most urgent.
All clear → one friendly line, no table. Never dump raw JSON.

## Continuous monitoring (daemon)

When the user wants to _watch_ rather than check once ("monitor this repo",
"tell me when CI finishes", "let me know if anyone requests a review"):

```bash
bash $SKILL/scripts/monitor.sh attach            # in a repo clone → scoped to that repo
bash $SKILL/scripts/monitor.sh attach --global   # everything (minus claimed repos)
bash $SKILL/scripts/monitor.sh attach --repo o/r # explicit scope
```

`attach` starts the daemon if needed and prints `{"session": "s…", "scope": …}`.
**Remember the session id for the rest of the conversation**, and tell the
user their scope in plain words.

**The routing rule** (this is the contract - state it accurately):

- A session attached from inside a repo clone is scoped to that repo and
  receives only that repo's notifications.
- A session attached with no git context is global: it receives every
  notification **except** those for repos currently claimed by another live
  repo-scoped session. So "watch everything else here, this repo is handled
  in the other conversation" works with zero configuration.
- Claims release on `detach` or after 2h without polling (stale sessions are
  pruned so a dead conversation can't silently eat notifications forever).

**Delivery, Monitor mode (recommended in-session — push, zero config).** After
`attach`, arm a persistent Monitor so events stream into the conversation as
notifications while you keep working — no settings.json changes:

```
Monitor(
  command: "while :; do bash $SKILL/scripts/monitor.sh poll <session-id> 2>/dev/null \
    | jq --unbuffered -r '\"[\" + (.severity|ascii_upcase) + \"] \" + .title + (if .url then \" — \" + .url else \"\" end)'; \
    sleep 60; done",
  description: "github events (<scope>)", persistent: true)
```

Polling doubles as the claim heartbeat. When events land, surface high-severity
ones briefly and keep working; if the user has likely stepped away, also send a
PushNotification (one line, ≤200 chars, lead with the actionable fact — the
tool self-suppresses when they're active). On "stop watching": TaskStop the
monitor, then `detach`.

**Delivery, hook mode (always-on across sessions).** Claude Code
injects a hook's stdout as conversation context on `UserPromptSubmit` and
`SessionStart`, so the bundled `scripts/hook_poll.sh` makes events arrive
automatically with every user message - no asking. Setup (with the user's
permission):

```bash
bash $SKILL/scripts/monitor.sh hook-config   # prints the settings.json snippet
```

Merge that into `~/.claude/settings.json` (UserPromptSubmit delivers;
SessionEnd is optional instant cleanup - TTL pruning covers it anyway).
Claude Code snapshots hooks at session start, so it takes effect in new
sessions - the user can review it with `/hooks`. Once installed, every
conversation auto-attaches on its first message, scoped by its cwd under the
exact routing rule above, and pending events appear as `[github-monitor]`
context lines. When they do: briefly surface the high-severity items, then
continue with the user's actual request. Don't also attach manually or
re-poll - the hook already did both. The hook always exits 0 (a non-zero
UserPromptSubmit hook can block the user's prompt) and prints nothing when
there's no news.

**Delivery, manual mode (no hook installed).** Run:

```bash
bash $SKILL/scripts/monitor.sh poll <session-id>
```

when the user asks "anything new?", and opportunistically between long tasks.
Empty output = no news (say so briefly only if asked). Each event is a JSON
line: `{ts, repo, type, severity, title, url}` - relay `high` severity
prominently, `info` in passing.

| Event type                                            | Meaning                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `review_requested` / `review_request_cleared`         | Someone wants (no longer wants) the user's review    |
| `ci_failed` / `ci_green`                              | Checks on their PR started failing / recovered       |
| `changes_requested` / `approved`                      | Review decision changed on their PR                  |
| `merge_conflict`                                      | Their PR now conflicts with base                     |
| `new_review_comments`                                 | Unresolved comments awaiting their reply increased   |
| `pr_merged` / `pr_closed`                             | Their PR left the open set (distinguished by lookup) |
| `issue_assigned`, `own_pr_tracked`, `monitor_started` | Informational                                        |

Lifecycle: `detach <id>` when the user says stop watching (the daemon keeps
serving other sessions); `stop` kills the daemon; `status` shows pid,
interval, and sessions; `start --interval 60` tunes the poll cadence
(default 120s ≈ 2 cheap GraphQL calls per tick - rate limits are a
non-issue). `tick` runs one cycle in the foreground for debugging. State
lives in `~/.local/state/github-monitor` (override: `GITHUB_MONITOR_DIR`).
Always tell the user when a daemon is left running and how to stop it.

## Follow-ups

**Review conversation detail** ("what are the comments on #412?") - use the
bundled drill-down, which fetches full threads via paginated GraphQL:

```bash
bash $SKILL/scripts/pr_review_threads.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/412
bash $SKILL/scripts/pr_review_threads.sh owner/repo#412 --all     # include resolved
```

It returns review submissions plus every unresolved thread with path, line,
and the complete comment chain (minimized comments filtered, long bodies
truncated). Summarize by theme unless asked otherwise. Do **not** use
`gh pr view --comments` for this - it only returns Conversation-tab comments
and misses inline review threads entirely.

Other drill-downs:

```bash
gh pr checks <url>                          # which checks failed
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed -R o/r    # CI failure logs
gh pr diff <url>                            # the actual changes
gh pr checkout <number> -R owner/repo       # work on it locally (needs a clone)
```

Other slices on request:

```bash
gh search prs --reviewed-by=@me --state=open --limit 20 \
  --json title,url,repository,updatedAt                    # PRs you reviewed
gh search prs --mentions=@me --state=open --limit 20 \
  --json title,url,repository,updatedAt                    # mentions
gh api notifications --jq '.[] | {reason, title: .subject.title, repo: .repository.full_name}'
```

**Stay read-only by default.** Merging, commenting, approving, resolving
threads, or closing anything requires an explicit user instruction. When
asked: `gh pr merge <url> --squash`, `gh pr comment <url> --body "..."`,
`gh pr review <url> --approve`, and the `resolveReviewThread` mutation (see
the review-data guide).

## Fallback

If the bundled scripts are unavailable, plain search gives the lists (no
CI/merge/thread data):

```bash
gh search prs --author=@me --state=open --limit 20 \
  --json number,title,repository,url,updatedAt,isDraft
gh search prs --review-requested=@me --state=open --limit 20 \
  --json number,title,repository,url,updatedAt,author,isDraft
```

Per-PR detail: `gh pr view <url> --json statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision,mergeable`.
Review-thread state has no CLI or REST equivalent - use the raw GraphQL from
the reference docs. Missing repos in results usually means token scope or
SSO authorization: check `gh auth status`.
