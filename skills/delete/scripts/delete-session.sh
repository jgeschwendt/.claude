#!/usr/bin/env bash
# delete-session.sh — close THIS session after `/delete` has erased it, and make sure
# the erase survives the CLI's own exit. Used by nothing else: ending a session normally is
# the SessionEnd router's job, and un-resumable-ness is no longer a goal (Claude Code keeps
# its transcripts, `cleanupPeriodDays: 3650`).
#
# Usage: delete-session.sh [scratchpad_dir]
#        delete-session.sh --watch-only        # arm the watcher, close nothing
#
# Flow: clean the scratchpad → resolve THIS session's CLI process (ancestor-only, never a
# sibling) → detach a watcher that erases the transcript the CLI writes on its way out →
# close the CLI (Ctrl-C twice, escalating to SIGTERM).
#
# The watcher is the load-bearing half. `sandman forget` erases the live `.jsonl` while the
# CLI is still running, and the CLI's final flush RE-CREATES it — a write that happens
# after every in-session tool call has returned, so nothing in-session can prevent it. The
# watcher outlives the CLI, waits for the pid to die, and erases whatever regrew.
#
# --watch-only exists for a background agent (`claude --bg`), which cannot close itself
# with signals: arm the watcher here, then stop the job from outside with
# `claude stop <short-id>`. Without it that ending leaves the regrown transcript on disk.
#
# Self-contained by rule: this script is the last thing a deleted conversation runs, so it
# depends on nothing but bash and the paths below. (The sid/component/projects-dir helpers
# were sourced from the orrery clone until 2026-08-25; they are inlined now.)
#
# Nothing is ever archived, copied, or buffered here. `/delete` is the ending that
# leaves nothing.
