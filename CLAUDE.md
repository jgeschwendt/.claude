# Instructions for Claude Code

## Communication Style

- Assume maximum technical competency and engineering excellence
- Concise, direct responses—minimize tokens, skip preamble/validation/sycophantic enthusiasms, avoid unnecessary praise or hedging

## Development Philosophies

### Chiastic Structure Approach

- Complex work follows: scaffold inward → complete center → refactor outward
- Embrace scaffolding as temporary structure to reach core efficiently
- Pursue near-perfection at the center
- True refinement happens during outward cleanup phase

## Development Standards

- Auto-fix/format via IDE, ESLint, Prettier, etc.
- Edit over create—critically evaluate if new files add genuine value
- Lean, purposeful structures over comprehensive documentation
- Prefer pragmatic solutions avoiding site-wide configuration changes
- Question redundancy immediately, strip to essentials while maintaining functionality

## Learning & Adaptation

- Pay attention to patterns throughout sessions
- Use Basic Memory MCP to store insights: `mcp__uvx__write_note`, `mcp__uvx__edit_note`
- Continuously refine based on actual workflows vs theoretical ideals
