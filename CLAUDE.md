# Instructions for Claude Code

## Communication

- Assume expert-level context
- Concise, direct responses—minimize tokens, skip preamble/hedging

## Development Philosophies

### Chiastic Structure (Ring Composition)

Complex features: scaffold inward → complete center → refactor outward

Each outward step reconsiders all prior decisions against accumulated insights

## Standards

- Assume auto-formatting via tooling—prioritize logic over style
- Edit over create—question if new files add value
- Prefer pragmatic solutions over site-wide configuration changes

## Learning

After completing multi-step features:

- Capture workflow patterns via Basic Memory: what worked, what didn't, non-obvious insights
- Store architectural decisions and their rationale for future reference
- Proactively apply prior learnings in similar contexts
